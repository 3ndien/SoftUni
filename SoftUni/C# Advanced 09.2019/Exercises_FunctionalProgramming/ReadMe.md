Problem 7.	Predicate for Names

Write a program that filters a list of names according to their length. On the first line, you will be given an integer n, representing a name's length. On the second line, you will be given some names as strings separated by space. Write a function that prints only the names whose length is less than or equal to n.

Problem 10: Predicate Party!

Ivancho?s parents are on a vacation for the holidays and he is planning an epic party at home. Unfortunately, his organizational skills are next to non-existent, so you are given the task to help him with the reservations.

On the first line, you receive a list with all the people that are coming. On the next lines, until you get the "Party!" command, you may be asked to double or remove all the people that apply to a given criteria. There are three different criteria: 

?	Everyone that has his name starting with a given string

?	Everyone that has a name ending with a given string

?	Everyone that has a name with a given length.

Finally, print all the guests who are going to the party separated by ", " and then add the ending "are going to the party!". If there are no guests going to the party print "Nobody is going to the party!". See the examples below:

Examples

INPUT:
___


Pesho Misho Stefan

Remove StartsWith P

Double Length 5

Party!

OUTPUT:
___

Misho, Misho, Stefan are going to the party!

INPUT:
___


Pesho

Double StartsWith Pesh

Double EndsWith esho

Party!

OUTPUT:
___

Problem 11.	  Party Reservation Filter Module

You need to implement a filtering module to a party reservation software. First, to the Party Reservation Filter Module (PRFM for short) is passed a list with invitations. Next the PRFM receives a sequence of commands that specify whether you need to add or remove a given filter.

Each PRFM command is in the given format:

"\{command;filter type;filter parameter}"

You can receive the following PRFM commands: 

?	"Add filter"

?	"Remove filter"

?	"Print" 

The possible PRFM filter types are: 

?	"Starts with"

?	"Ends with"

?	"Length"

?	"Contains"

All PRFM filter parameters will be a string (or an integer only for the "Length" filter). Each command will be valid e.g. you won?t be asked to remove a non-existent filter. The input will end with a "Print" command, after which you should print all the party-goers that are left after the filtration. See the examples below:

Examples

INPUT:
___

Pesho Misho Slav

Add filter;Starts with;P

Add filter;Starts with;M

Print

OUTPUT:
___

Slav

INPUT:
___


Pesho Misho Jica

Add filter;Starts with;P

Add filter;Starts with;M

Remove filter;Starts with;M

Print


OUTPUT:
___

___


Problem 12: TriFunction

Write a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the first name, whose sum of characters is equal to or larger than a given number N, which will be given on the first line. Use a function that accepts another function as one of its parameters. Start off by building a regular function to hold the basic logic of the program. Something along the lines of Func<string, int, bool>. Afterwards create your main function which should accept the first function as one of its parameters.

Examples

INPUT:
___

800

Qvor Qnaki Petromir Sadam

OUTPUT:
___
