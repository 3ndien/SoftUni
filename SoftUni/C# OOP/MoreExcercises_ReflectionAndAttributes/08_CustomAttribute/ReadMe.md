Problem 8.	Create Custom Class Attribute

Create a custom attribute that can be applied to classes and can be accessed at runtime. The attribute type elements it should contain are author, revision, description and reviewers. Apply the attribute to the Weapon class you have created for the Inferno Infinity problem. Provide these exact values:

•	author = "Pesho"

•	revision = 3

•	description = "Used for C# OOP Advanced Course - Enumerations and Attributes."

•	reviewers = "Pesho", "Svetlio"

Implement additional commands for extracting different attribute values:

•	Author - prints the author of the class

•	Revision - prints the revision of the class

•	Description - prints the class description

•	Reviewers - prints the reviewers of the class
